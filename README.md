# 8Pawns

## Description

8Pawns is a simplified chess variant where each player starts with only the 8 pawns on a regular chessboard.
The objective is to either:
- capture all opposing pawns
- reach the last row with a pawn
- leave the opponent with no legal move

The moves are identical as in chess:
- pawns move forward to an empty square, and capture diagonally
- pawns on their starting square can move either one or two squares forward
- pawns on their respective 5th row can capture an opposing pawn that has just moved two squares, and land as if the opposing pawn had moved only one square ("en-passant")
